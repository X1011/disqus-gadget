Hello, World gadget
==================
The hello world gadget has taken some liberty with the typical hello
world format.

This gadget serves as an example for a few types of interaction between
the gadget and the course player via the
[versal-player-api](https://github.com/Versal/player-api), which is
available as a bower component under that name.

Types of interactions:
  - Asset uploading
  - setAttributes / onAttributesChanged
  - setLearnerState / onLearnerStateChanged

Please see the [gadget developer
intro](https://github.com/Versal/gadget-dev-intro/) for more information
about gadget development.

### Build Steps
